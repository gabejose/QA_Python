# Bitwise operators
# Used to compare (binary) numbers

# & (AND) - sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
# | (OR) - sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
# ^ (XOR) - sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
# ~ (NOT) - inverts all the bits
# << (Zero fill left shift) - Shift left by ushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
# >> (Signed right shift) - Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
