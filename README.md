# QA_Python

This repository contains all notes I make for learning how to
use Python (the basics at least). Using W3Schools as my reference, I can hopefully get a good grasp on using Python and expanding my programming knowledge.

## Getting Started
I've been using Visual Studio Code for writing notes and example python files (.py) to output results in the console.

## Pre - requisites
The following software is required in order to run the files:

* Visual Studio Code (Download from https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

* Python extension on VSCode for formatting (search Python in extensions)

* Pylance extension on VSCode (search Pylance in extensions)

* Python on your computer (Download from https://www.python.org/) dependent on which OS your computer uses 

## Installing

Follow instructions in pre - requisites for downloading software and extensions for VSCode

## Running the files
Clone this repo down to your computer into a folder of your choosing. Then open QA_Python in VSCode. From the terminal in VSCode, cd into one of the folders (e.g. 001-Intro, 002-Strings, etc). To run one of the files in the folder, type into the terminal (remember to include the .py extension):

```
python <name of file.py>

```
