# Dictionary
# Used to store data in key:value pairs

# A dictionary is a collection which is:
# - ordered (3.6 and earlier, dictionaries weren't ordered)
# - changeable
# - no duplicates

# Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:
# E.g. Create and print a dictionary:

thisdict = {
    "brand": "Ford",
    "model": "Mustang",
    "year": 1964
}

print(thisdict)
