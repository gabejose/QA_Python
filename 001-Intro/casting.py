# Casting
# This is when you want to specify a type on to a variable
# This is done using constructor functions:

# - int() constructs an integer number from an integer literal,
# a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (
# assuming the string represents a whole number)

# - float() constructs a float number from an integer literal,
# a float literal or a string literal (provided the string represents
# a float or integer)

# - str() constructs a string from a wide variety of data types,
# including strings, integer literals and float literals

x = int(1)
y = float(2.8)
z = int("4")
